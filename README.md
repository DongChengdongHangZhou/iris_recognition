# iris_recognition
This is the repository containing a simple, yet powerful, resolution of an iris recognition task. It is achieved by using Daugman's approach, where it extracts from the iris an entity called ```iris code```, which is further used as an unique identification matrix. 

The code is well commented and written in .m files (MATLAB). Feel free to use or ask any questions. Note that it is also included the UBIRIS dataset, under their reference (http://iris.di.ubi.pt/). Also, note that you will the ```Mapping Toolbox``` in order to run the code.
